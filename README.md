# Stare Interpreter
A Stack-Rewriting Esoteric Programming Language
## Introduction
Stare is an Esoteric-ish Programming language (that is, designed to actually be useful in some cases) designed by the Zodiac Working Group. This repo hosts some prototype interpreters for every dialect of Stare written in python. Later interperters will compile to the Taurus Virtual Machine.

## Concept
Stare is based around stack rewriting; that is, it uses a system based on analyzing attributes about the stack and makes decisions based on those attributes.

## Computaional Class
Stare's Computational Class is unknown, but it is suspected by the author that it is Turing Complete by the 1.2 dialect. Anything earlier should be at least as powerful as a push-down automaton.
